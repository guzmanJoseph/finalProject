<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 </h1>

Group name: GatorPathfinders

This project uses Python, Streamlit, and the Bridges API to create an interactive web application that finds the shortest path between two locations on the University of Florida campus.

## Overview
This app provides a user-friendly interface that computes and visualizes the shortest route between two campus points, helping students and visitors save time and effort.

## Features
- An interactive web interfce.
- Uses algorithms Dijkstraâ€™s and A* to determine the optimal path.
- Clearly displays the shortest route on a map using Bridges API.

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit for the interface creation
- Python
- Bridges API to handle data and visualize graph
- OpenStreet Map for map data

## Running the code
- Install streamlit and bridges packages
- Run the following line in your terminal: streamlit run app.py
- This will open a url in your browser
